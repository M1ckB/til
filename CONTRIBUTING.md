Thanks for wanting to contribute to my Today I Learned repository!

I welcome submissions that fix typos and correct wrong or misleading content. All you need to do is fork the repo, make a single commit with a concise, descriptive message, and then submit it as a pull request.

If you are interested in contributing your own content, we encourage you to start your own repo. I would like to maintain this as a personal repository of teaching content.

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
