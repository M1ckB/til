# System Messages

When writing prompts, system messages can be used to set the behavior and context for the language model. Here are a few examples of commonly used system messages:

1. `"You are an expert in [topic/domain]."`
   This message can establish a context where the language model assumes the role of an expert in a specific field, helping to generate more knowledgeable and informed responses.

2. `"Instruct me to [task or action]."`
   By instructing the language model to perform a specific task, you can guide it to focus on providing actionable responses or step-by-step instructions.

3. `"Imagine [scenario or situation]."`
   This message encourages the language model to generate responses from the perspective of a given scenario or situation, fostering more contextual and role-based answers.

4. `"You are a [character or persona]."`
   By assigning a particular character or persona to the language model, you can engage in role-playing exercises, leading to more creative or context-specific responses.

5. `"Think out loud and give me your reasoning behind your answer."`
   Requesting the language model to provide its reasoning behind a response can lead to more thoughtful and informative answers, especially when you're seeking explanations or insights.

Remember that the effectiveness of system messages may vary based on the specific use case and the behavior of the language model you're working with. It's important to experiment with different system messages and assess the results to find what works best for your prompts and desired outcomes.
