# Rewriting Questions

Usually, questions don't make good prompts. Thus, **questions need to be rewritten for prompting to obtain good results from the GPT**.

GPT can be used to generate a more optimal prompt by asking:

```md
I am trying to get good results from GPT on the following question:

"""
[question]
"""

Could you write a prompt that is more optimal for GPT and would produce better results?
```
